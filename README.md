# PROJECT: Classification of Forest Cover Type Using Cartographic Variables ***(Built using PySpark)***

The project intoduces how Pyspark can be utilized to solve Machine Learning Problems. The dataset used is taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository (Click [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Covertype))

## About Pyspark:
Apache Spark is written in Scala programming language. PySpark has been released in order to support the collaboration of Apache Spark and Python, it actually is a Python API for Spark. In addition, PySpark, helps you interface with Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) in Apache Spark and Python programming language. You can read more about Apache Spark [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Spark)

## Introduction
Accurate natural resource inventory information is vital to any private, state, or federal land management agency. Forest cover type is one of the most basic characteristics recorded in such inventories. Generally, cover type data is either directly recorded by field personnel or estimated from remotely sensed data. Both of these techniques may be prohibitively time-consuming and: or costly in some situations. Furthermore, an agency may find it useful to have inventory information for adjoining lands that are not directly under its control, where it is often economically or legally impossible to collect inventory data. Predictive models provide an alternative method for obtaining such data.
